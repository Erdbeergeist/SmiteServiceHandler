# SmiteServiceHandler

These two little Programs work together to keep the HighRez Service stopped and only start it when needed.

This works for my configuration and not neccessarily for you, but feel free to try.

Put both, the SmiteServiceHandler.exe and the SteamLauncherUI.exe in your High-Rez Studios Folder.
Rename the original SteamLauncherUI.exe into SteamLauncherUIorig.exe
